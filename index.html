<p>I am a software engineer and author from the seaside tech hub of Shenzhen, China. I received a Bachelor of Arts degree from <a href="https://www.pomona.edu/">Pomona College</a> in Claremont, California, where I majored in Computer Science and Mathematical Economics. Currently, I am an engineer at Laserfiche in Long Beach, California. My engineering interests include natural language processing and machine learning. I made <a href=https://github.com/lizhao1993/qualia>an automated screenplay evaluation model</a> for my undergrad thesis. I also made this <a href=https://quora-poem.appspot.com/>Quora poem generator</a>, inspired by <a href="http://splinternews.com/a-poem-about-silicon-valley-assembled-from-quora-quest-1793856489.">this poem.</a> <a href="resume.pdf">Read my resume.</a></p>
<p>I have been a writer since age 7, publishing three fiction and one non-fiction book. I've also written TV animation scripts and songs. My work has been in a handful of anthologies and received some prizes. My favorite authors include John Steinbeck, Sylvia Plath, Katherine Mansfield, and Lu Xun. I enjoy reading traditional literature, detective fiction and ancient Chinese literature.</p>
<p>When I'm not writing code or novels, I make and eat food, and play guitar.</p>
